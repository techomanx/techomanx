👋 Hi, I’m @techomanx! After 24 years of navigating the digital frontiers of the banking industry, transforming everything from mainframe monoliths to sleek public cloud solutions, my fascination with programming features that captivate the mind (much like a cat with a woolen ball, or perhaps a particularly elegant algorithm) is stronger than ever.

👀 I’m deeply interested in the sweet spot where robust financial technology meets innovative solutions. Think high-performance FX engines, sophisticated risk management systems, and the art of making complex data tell clear, compelling stories. Currently, I'm channeling this passion into the vibrant Python data science ecosystem.

🌱 I’m sharpening my toolkit with numpy and matplotlib, because even a seasoned pro enjoys adding new spells to their book! The mission? Not just to learn libraries one by one, but to eventually wield them to revolutionize financial data visualization and craft insightful analytics. I'll get there, one elegant solution at a time...

💞️ I'm always on the lookout for ingenious ways to build efficient, distraction-free solutions  and foster clarity – whether it's in code, within a team, or in my own relentless pursuit of focus. Open to collaborating on forward-thinking fintech projects or any challenge that pushes the boundaries of modern technology in finance.

🚀 My Evolving Tech Landscape & Areas of Adventure:

 - Core Experience Built On: Decades working with Mainframes, C++, .NET/C#, Sybase/PostgreSQL, and leading critical projects in channels payments, FX distribution, reconciliations, intraday funding, and collateral management. 

- Current & Future Focus: Mastering Public Cloud architecture (especially AWS, building on experience like FX engine migrations ), deepening expertise in Python for Data Science (Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-learn), exploring advanced API Design, Microservices, DevOps & MLOps best practices.
- On My Radar: Practical applications of AI/ML in RegTech, advanced financial analytics, and continuously improving security in distributed systems.
